        This streamlit app provides real-time statistics and historical data of chess players 
        in an interactive and visually appealing format. The app allows users to explore details about player profiles, 
        including performance in various time controls like bullet, blitz, and rapid as well as various game varients like 
        chess, bughouse, threecheck, chess960, kingofhill and crazyhouse.

        - **Dynamic Player Selection**: User can select any player available from already existing dataframe using dropdown.
        - **Player Profile Display**: Users can view dynamic player profiles that include avatars, names, titles, 
        country flags, and chess-related metrics like followers and ratings just like in chess.com's official site.
        - **Data Filtering**: Players' ratings chart is filterable by specific time periods (e.g., last year, 
        last three years, all time) using tabs styled for a smooth user experience.
        - **Player Info**: The app fetches and displays players' personal life, achievements, chess career etc. dynamically.
        from Wikipedia API.
        - **Real-time Data**: Real-time data extraction allows users to view up-to-date statistics extracted directly from [Chess.com's Public API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api), with a progress 
        bar indicating data loading time.

        The app uses Streamlit components for a sleek, interactive interface. Users can select 
        players from a dropdown or text input, view data in an organized multi-column layout, and enjoy custom-styled

        experience.

        - **Handeling Slow Loading Times:** Using st.cache_data for loading data so it does not load everytime app refreshes.      
        - **Image Rendering:**  Had a problem displaying png/jpg images inside markdown, so had to convert ***PNG/JPG*** format to ***Base64*** encoding.
        - **Plotly Chart Visibiity:**  Had chart visibility issue because of the app's dark background, so with the help of browser inspect tool changes *.stPlotlyChart's* background to white providing better contrast and number visibility.
        - **Showing Player's Country Flag:** Extracted players countrycode and using flagcdn.com for dynamically showing country flag.
        - **Making st.selectbox and st.tab text color different:** After long long struggle of using devtools and streamlit community issues since they share same classname, I was finally able to solve this issue using css hack from streamlit creator @andfanilo.
